            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minesweeper is a popular single-player computer game that has been around
                since the early 1990s. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular
                board containing hidden mines without detonating any of them.
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The board is divided into a grid of squares, and each square can either be
                empty or contain a mine. The player has to uncover the squares one by one,
                using clues given by the numbers displayed on the squares. The numbers indicate
                the number of mines in the eight squares surrounding the numbered square.
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To win the game, the player must uncover all the squares that do not contain
                mines,
                while flagging or marking the squares that do contain mines. If the player uncovers
                a square with a mine, the game is over and the player loses.
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minesweeper is a game of logic and deduction, and its popularity has led to
                numerous variations and adaptations of the original game over the years.

            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instructions for starting the Minesweeper game can vary depending on the
                platform
                or device you are playing on. However, here are some general steps to get started:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Open the Minesweeper online Game on your device (go back one page from the current location).</li>
                <li>Choose the level of difficulty you want to play. Minesweeper has three difficulty levels:
                    beginner (easy), intermediate (medium), and expert (hard).</li>
                <li>The game board will be displayed with covered squares. Left-click on any square to reveal it. If
                    it's a mine, the game is over. If it's a number, the number indicates the number of mines adjacent
                    to that square.</li>
                <li>Use the numbers to deduce where the mines are and use right-click to flag or mark a square that you
                    think contains a mine.</li>
                <li>Continue to reveal and flag squares until you have revealed all the squares that do not contain
                    mines. If you flag all the squares that contain mines, you win the game!</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember, Minesweeper is a game of logic and deduction, so take your time and
                use the clues provided to make informed decisions. Good luck playing!

            <h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Start with the corners and edges: Mines are more likely to be found in the center of the board, so
                    start by uncovering the squares on the corners and edges to reduce the number of possible mine
                    locations.</li>
                <li>Use the numbers to deduce where mines are: Each number on the board indicates the number of mines in
                    the adjacent squares. Use this information to deduce where the mines might be.</li>
                <li>Use right-click to flag or mark a square: If you suspect a square contains a mine, use the
                    right-click to flag it. This helps you keep track of which squares you think contain mines.</li>
                <li>Look for patterns: In Minesweeper, certain patterns can indicate where mines are likely to be. For
                    example, if two squares have the same number and only one square adjacent to them is uncovered, that
                    square likely contains a mine.</li>
                <li>Take calculated risks: Sometimes you might need to make an educated guess to progress in the game.
                    Look for squares where mines are likely to be based on the numbers, and take calculated risks to
                    uncover those squares.</li>
                <li>Play regularly: Like any game, Minesweeper takes practice to get good at. Play regularly to improve
                    your skills and learn new strategies.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By following these tips and tricks, you'll be well on your way to becoming a
                Minesweeper master! Good luck playing!
